<h1>K MEANS CLUSTERING ALORITHM</h1>

i) K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

ii) Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.

iii) It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties.

iv) It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.

v) It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid.

vi) The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.

<h2>ABOUT THE DATA SET</h2>

The data was collected from a well known e-commerce website over a period of time based on the customerâ€™s search profile.

It has the following data columns:

Cust_ID : Unique numbering for customers

Gender : Gender of the customer

Orders : Number of orders placed by each customer in the past.

Remaining 35 features which are the brands of the respected product that are available in the market.

And these columns contains the number of times customers have searched the particular brands.

<h1>E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING K-MEANS:</h1>
<h1>PROBELM STATEMENT:</h1>
Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest.
